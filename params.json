{"name":"Tefel","tagline":"A PHP package for parsing Transport for London data feeds, includes support for Laravel 4.","body":"### Welcome to Tefel\r\nTefel is a PHP package for paring the Transport for London data feeds. It includes support for Laravel 4.\r\n\r\nCurrently there is only support for extracting station facilities data and line information.\r\n\r\nMore information about the TFL Open Data feeds can be found at [https://www.tfl.gov.uk/info-for/open-data-users/](https://www.tfl.gov.uk/info-for/open-data-users/).\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nNote that for this library function you will have needed to obtain access to the TFL open data feeds and been given an `app_id` and `app_key`.\r\n\r\n#### Plain ol' PHP\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$tefel = new Tefel($stationFacilitiesFeedUrl, $appId, $appKey);\r\n/** @var $stations Tefel\\Feed\\Station[] */\r\n$stations = $tefel->getStations();\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Laravel 4\r\n\r\nTo setup Tefel with Laravel 4 it's the usual setup process as with any package.\r\n\r\nAdd the following entries to your _app/config/app.php_:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n'providers' => array(\r\n  // ...\r\n  'Tefel\\TefelServiceProvider',\r\n),\r\n```\r\n\r\nA facade is available for use in Laravel 4:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n'aliases' => array(\r\n  // ...\r\n  'TFL' => 'Tefel\\Facade\\TefelFacade',\r\n),\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsage is then more familiar for Laravel 4 users:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n/** @var $stations Tefel\\Feed\\Station[] */\r\n$stations = Tefel::getStations();\r\n```\r\n\r\nConfiguration is available for the package in Laravel 4. You can publish the configuration to your application by running:\r\n\r\n```\r\nphp artisan config:publish mramsden/tefel\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Configuration**\r\n\r\n| Name              | Description                                           |\r\n|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| stations_feed_url | The URL to download the station facilities feed from. |\r\n| app_id            | The app id issued to you by TFL.                      |\r\n| app_key           | The app key issued to you by TFL.                     |\r\n\r\nNote that you don't need to change the `app_id` and `app_key` values in your own configuration file. You can also assign these values through the `TFL_APP_ID` and `TFL_APP_KEY` environment variables respectively.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nThe MIT License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 Marcus Ramsden.\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
